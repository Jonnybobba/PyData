After the Py_Poll_Data.zip has been unzipped, the PyPoll.py program will read the resulting csv file Py_Poll_Data.csv and find the following results

  > The total vote count for the entire election
  > The overall vote count for each candidate
  > The perecent of total vote count for each candidate
  > The winner of the election
  
After all these results have been found, the program will export the results to the output folder in the file pypoll_results.txt
