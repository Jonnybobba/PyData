The program PyBank.py is designed to read the record profit and losses presented in Py_Bank_Data.csv and give the following results

  > Total months recorded
  > Total change
  > Average change
  > Greatest profit
  > Greatest loss

After all these values have been calculated, the program will export the results to the output folder under the title pybank_results.txt
